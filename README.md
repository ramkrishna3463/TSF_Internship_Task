# The Sparks Foundation - Data Science & Business Analytics Tasks

This repository consist of the tasks given during my internship at The Sparks Foundation.

# About The Sparks Foundation

The S.P.A.R.K.S. Foundation is a 501©3 non-profit organization dedicated to the mission of providing hands-on science education to elementary-aged students, regardless of socio-economic status. The philosophy of the S.P.A.R.K.S. Foundation is grounded in the fact that learning in science begins in early childhood. Young minds are curious about science and ready to engage in the practices and language of science. These principles— learned at an early age—form a foundation to be built upon and strengthened throughout a student’s K-12 education. Studies show that our nation’s employers are asking for more employees who have the technical skills to help them compete in today’s economy. We need more engineers, chemists, computer programmers, healthcare professionals, etc. and we must start with our youth to inspire them now to pursue STEM learning and careers later on..The Sparks Foundation mission is to inspire students, help them innovate, and let them integrate to build the next generation humankind. To inspire, motivate, and encourage students to learn, create, and help build a better society. To teach new ways of thinking, to innovate and solve the problems on their own. We help the students to integrate and help each other, learn from each other, and do well together.

# TASKS

## Task 1 - Exploring Supervised Machine Learning

Predict the score of an student based on the no. of study hours.

In this regression task we will predict the percentage of marks that a student is expected to score based upon the number of hours they studied.This is a simple linear regression task as it involves just two variables.Data can be found at http://bit.ly/w-data. What will be predicted score if a student study for 9.25 hrs in a day?

## Task 2 - Exploring Unsupervised Machine Learning

From the given 'Iris' dataset, predict the optimum number of clusters and represent it visually.

## Task 3 - Exploring Decision Tree Algorithm

For the given 'Iris' dataset, create the Decision Tree classifier and visualize it graphically. The purpose is if we feed any new data to this classifier, it would be able to predict the right class accordingly.
